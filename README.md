# Software Design Pattern in C++17/20
### Rommel de Sene Trindade.
##### About this project.
> This project covers some design patterns as defined by Gang of four implemented using basically C++17. The iterator pattern was implemented using the C++20 despite it was still a draft because at the time of the implementation it was the only version that supported coroutines.

>It takes as base reference the Udemy Course taught by Dmitri Nesteruk  and many changes were made on code to improve my own cognition process. As said by the teacher, the code does not follow the lastest better practices like move semantics, private members, virtual destructors, and so on once the main goal is keep the focus on the design patterns pratices.
